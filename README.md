OpenAcc
=======

Open Access Area Locator is a web application for tracking the availability of PCs in the open access areas in the University of Portsmouth as well as providing geographical information such as the distance between the user and each location and links to navigate to them using Google Maps or Google Navigation.


Description
===========

OpenAcc was developed in its entirety during [ShipIt II](https://sites.google.com/a/port.ac.uk/shipitnovember13/), a codeathon for creating applications that will be helpful to the University of Portsmouth and its students. Out of the 19 ideas that were submitted for ShipIt, only 7 of them were voted highly enough to be eligible to enter the codeathon, OpenAcc being one of them.

The codeathon started at 4pm on the 12th of November 2013 and ended at 4pm on the 13th of November 2013. Open Access Area Locator came in the second place for the idea that would genuinely benefit the University of Portsmouth and Information Services.
